abstract = {Planning algorithms are impacting technical disciplines and industries around the world, including robotics, computer-aided design, manufacturing, computer graphics, aerospace applications, drug design, and protein folding. This coherent and comprehensive book unifies material from several sources, including robotics, control theory, artificial intelligence, and algorithms. The treatment is centered on robot motion planning, but integrates material on planning in discrete spaces. A major part of the book is devoted to planning under uncertainty, including decision theory, Markov decision processes, and information spaces, which are the 'configuration spaces' of all sensor-based planning problems. The last part of the book delves into planning under differential constraints that arise when automating the motions of virtually any mechanical system. This text and reference is intended for students, engineers, and researchers in robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory as well as computer graphics, algorithms, and computational biology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Loss of control prevention for aircraft remains an active area of research to improve aviation safety. Two separate numerical methods are presented here and were used to generate attitude and flight vector recovery solutions for a simulated aircraft model in an initial upset condition. The problem is posed as an optimal control problem and both methods' general approach uses a reduced-order mathematical model of a sub-scale jet airliner simulation model. The first method discussed uses a method called dynamic programming (DP) to generate a discrete closed-loop solution and the second method uses direct transcription and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to generate an open-loop solution. The two methods' trajectory solutions are compared with an illustrative example and it was found that both methods' solutions use the same maneuver strategy to recover the aircraft model's trajectory back to wings level flight. In conclusion the DP is limited to a reduced model to remain tractable while the SQP can use a more accurate and representative model, and the DP method is computationally expensive offline while the SQP method is expensive online.},

@article{Singh2002,
abstract = {Precise position control and rapid rest-to-rest motion is the desired objective in a variety of applications. The desire for reducing the maneuver time requires reducing the inertia of the structure which subsequently results in low frequency dynamics. The requirement of precise position control implies that the residual vibration of the structure should be zero or near zero. This paper presents techniques to shape the input to the system so as to minimize the residual vibration. A second class of problems which includes design of input profiles for systems with rigid-body modes driven by actuators with finite control authority, is also presented. The common thread which connects all the techniques presented in this paper is related to the design of controllers which are robust to modeling uncertainties. The proposed techniques are illustrated by simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {This paper considers the control of a multirotor-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a suspended load. The load is modeled as a pendulum, with a rigid link. We consider the case when the suspended load is connected to the centre of gravity of the UAV, and the interconnected system is modeled by Kane's method. A nonlinear controller based on the backstepping technique is derived, that ensures trajectory tracking of the UAV regardless of the pendulum motion. The origin of the tracking error is proved to be globally asymptotically stable, and results are verified by simulations.},

abstract = {Input shaping is a command modification technique for reducing system vibration that has been implemented successfully on a number of mechanical systems. Input shaping was developed from linear systems theory, but it has been applied successfully to many nonlinear systems. Of the approaches used to shape commands for nonlinear systems, very few address the specific nonlinearities of the systems directly. This paper addresses a special subset of configuration-dependent nonlinearities. The effect of input shaping on these types of systems is analyzed and key motion command parameters are extracted. This analysis is utilized to design effective zero-vibration input shapers for the class of nonlinear systems considered here.},

@article{Smith1957,
abstract = {A novel method is presented for producing dead-bea response in a lightly-damped oscillatory feedback system. Complete transient response times of the order of a fraction of the natural oscillatory period can be obtained. Excellent waveshape reproduction is achieved through a linear phase lag with frequency. The method consists of exciting several transient oscillations, at closely spaced times, with magnitudes and phases so adjusted that the resultant sum of the transient oscillation phasors is zero. The steady-state output is the arithmetic sum of the excitation magnitudes. When a step input transient is divided into two spaced excitations, one-half cycle response is obtainable. When the input transient is divided into three excitations, one-fourth period or faster transient times are realizable, depending upon the available dynamic range or signal-to-noise ratio. The principle of design is to adjust a system to the maximum possible resonant frequency, independent of the damping factor, but stable, and then to apply the Posicast control to completely remove the oscillatory component in the output. In an electrical feedback control system, the additional hardware consists of one or two artificial transmission lines.},

A control design is presented for the system specialized to the planar case, that enables tracking of either the quadrotor attitude, the load attitude or the position of the load. Stability proofs for the controller design and experimental validation of the proposed controller are presented.},

These applications include search and rescue missions; disaster relief operations, such as forest fires [1]; and environmental monitoring and surveillance. In some of these tasks, UAVs work in coordination with other robots, as in robot-assisted inspection at sea [2]. Recently, radio-controlled UAVs carrying radiation sensors and video cameras were used to monitor, diagnose, and evaluate the situation at Japans Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant facility [3].},
